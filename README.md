# Environmental Informatics

## Assignment 01 - introduction to the Python Programming Language

### Reading Assignment

- [Think Python 2e](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/), Chapters 1-3
- Asssignments at this point in the class are graded mostly on documentation, so read this answer to [How do I use comments effectively?]( https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=47221326) before submitting your assignment.

### Practical Practice

- Complete the tutorial at [Getting Started with Python on Purdue Cluster Computing](https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/environmentalinformatics/Getting+started+with+Python+on+Purdue+Cluster+Computing) to get yourself setup and ready to work through the first three chapters of the Think Python book.
- If you are new to GitHUB, check out the [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial from GitHUB to learn the basics.
  - If you are working on the Scholar cluster through thinlinc running in the web browser, you will not be able to copy from the desktop into thinlinc.  You can either:
    - Open the firefox browser inside thinlinc (e.g., type "firefox >& /dev/null &" at the Linux terminal command prompt.  The ">& /dev/null" will send warning messages to trash, while the final "&" will run firefox in the background giving you the terminal prompt back - more on this later in the class).  You can then copy and paste between firefox and your teminal and spyder windows.
    - Install the thinlinc application on your laptop, you can set the options to allow copying and pasting between thinlinc and the rest of your computer.

### What to Submit

1. **Think Python Chapter 3: Exercises 3.2** \[15 pts; do parts 1 through 4 and submit script for part 4, do not write "do_four" script\]. 

   - **Note:** In earlier editions of  the Think Python book this problem was numbered Exercise 3.4, as activities within the chapter were also numbered and the first exercise at the end of the chapter was not numbered starting at 1.  Make sure that you submit the program called "do_four".
   - Save your program as Exercise_3.2.py (if using Python directly) or Exercise_3.2.ipynb (if using Jupyter Notebook) for submission.
   
2. **Think Python Chapter 3: Exercise 3.3.**  

   - **Note** In earlier editions of the Think Python book this was numbered Exercise 3.5, as activities within the chapter were also numbered and the first exercise at the end of the chapter was not numbered starting at 1.
   - Save your program as Exercise_3.3.py (if using Python directly) or Exercise_3.2.ipynb (if using Jupyter Notebook) for submission.
